The only non-printing characters in the file that can be used to format the text are newline, tab, and formfeed. Plain text files are often displayed using a monospace font so horizontal alignment and columnar formatting is sometimes done using space characters.
Word processor documents are generally stored in a binary format to allow for localization and formatted text, such as boldface, italics and multiple fonts, and to be structured into columns and tables.
Although they are often viewed with formatting, documents using markup languages are stored in plain text files that contain a combination of human-readable text and markup tags. For example, web pages are plain text with HTML tags to achieve formatting when rendered by a web browser. Many web pages also contain embedded JavaScript that is interpreted by the browser.</div>
