    1.Jitterberg Perfume by Tom Robbins <br/> "Okay, so thOkay, so this book has an 8th century time-traveling Bohemian king, 
        a hyper-sexual goat-god, a New Orleans perfumer and a character actually called Bingo Pajama (among many, MANY other things). Need I say more?"

       <br/> 2.One Hundred Years Of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez <br/>
        "One of the best family sagas + magical realism books to have ever been written. It gets super confusing however. Seriously, there are 6 characters with the SAME name."

        <br/><br/>3.The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami <br/>
        "This book is so big that could hit someone over the head with it and give them a concussion... But somehow I wish it were longer."

        <br/>4.Hard-Boiled Wonderland And The End Of The World by Haruki Murakami <br/>"No one does surrealism like Murakami. If you can't tell already, he's my favorite author by a mile."<br/>

      <br/>5.To The Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf <br/>"It was a hard book to get through since some sentences ended up being the length of an entire paragraph, but I learned to let myself just drift through Virginia Woolf's prose. No other book I've read has ever captured the human thought process so perfectly."<br/>
